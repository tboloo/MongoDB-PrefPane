MongoDB-PrefPane
================

MongoDB prefPane for MacOSX. Heavily influenced by [Remy Saissy's mongodb-macosx-prefspane](https://github.com/remysaissy/mongodb-macosx-prefspane)

Functionalities
===============

Runs MongoDB on OSX Mountain Lion.
Provides mongod status.

Prerequisites
=============

Does not include mongodb binaries, therefore you first need to install them from http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

Installation
============

Get the newest build from [jenkins](https://btekielski.ci.cloudbees.com/job/mongod-pane/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/*zip*/archive.zip), unzip it and install mongod-pane.prefPane by right clicking on the file, choosing Open and then again confirm by clicking Open (at this moment binary is not signed and thus the OS X warning)
